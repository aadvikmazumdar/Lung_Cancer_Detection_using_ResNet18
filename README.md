## Overview

This repository contains a deep learning solution for automated lung cancer classification using the ResNet-18 architecture. The model achieves **98.50%** accuracy on the validation dataset, effectively distinguishing between lung adenocarcinoma (ACA), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and normal lung tissue.

## Features

- **High Accuracy:** Achieves 98.50% validation accuracy
- **Multi-class Classification:** Distinguishes between adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and normal tissue
- **Transfer Learning:** Leverages ResNet-18 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet
- **Reproducible Results:** Complete pipeline from data preparation to evaluation

- 
## Training Details
The model was trained using the following configuration:

- **Architecture:** ResNet-18 with modified final layer
- **Optimizer:** Adam with learning rate 0.001
- **Loss Function:** Cross-entropy loss
- **Batch Size:** 32
- **Data Augmentation:** Random horizontal flip, rotation, and normalization
- **Early Stopping:** Patience of 10 epochs

## Dataset

This project utilizes a dataset of CT scan images to train the model. The dataset consists of labeled images of **malignant** and **benign** tumors for lung cancer classification. It is used for detecting potential lung cancer cases from medical images.
